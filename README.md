Automated PowerPoint Slideshow GeneratorA Python script to instantly turn a folder of images into a polished, widescreen PowerPoint presentation. Perfect for event technicians, marketing teams, or anyone who needs to quickly create a looping slideshow from a batch of photos.The Problem It SolvesEver been handed a flash drive with hundreds of photos moments before an event, with the request to "get these on the big screen"? This script automates that entire process, saving you from the tedious manual work of inserting, resizing, and centering each image in PowerPoint.Key Features‚úÖ Smart Image Processing: Automatically verifies that files are valid images, skipping corrupt files or non-image documents.üîÑ Auto-Rotation: Reads camera EXIF data to correctly orient photos, so portrait shots don't end up sideways.‚ö°Ô∏è Optimized for Screens: Resizes images to a maximum of 1920x1080 (Full HD), drastically reducing the final .pptx file size without sacrificing quality on screen.üé® Standardized Format: Converts all images (including PNGs with transparency) to a consistent JPEG format.‚ú® Polished Output: Creates a clean, 16:9 widescreen presentation with each image perfectly centered.üßπ Automatic Cleanup: Uses a temporary folder for processing and deletes it when finished, keeping your original folder clean.RequirementsYou'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system.
